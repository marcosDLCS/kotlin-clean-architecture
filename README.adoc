= Kotlin clean architecture
:toc:

== Goals

The goal of this project is to **practice with different technologies and tools within the Kotlin ecosystem**, as well as to **illustrate concepts of 'clean architecture'**.

The project will consist of **several interconnected services with differentiated responsibilities**. Each of them may be built with different libraries or resources.

The domain of the project will be the simulation of **a simple social network in which to register users and publish messages** that will travel between the different services enriching them.

Each project will contain readme-like text documents listing and explaining different concepts. The code will also sometimes contain comment blocks giving further explanation of the decisions taken.

== Tools

One of the main motivations of the project is to have a playground to test new tools or libraries that I can't use in my day-to- day life or that I want to go deeper into.

The following list contains a selection of projects that I would like to include in the different services of the repository.
